# Final-Coursework---Daiva-Salc
I created the website for my paintings (I‘m the painter in my free time) because I want to sell them. 
I don't need much information for this type of website because for me the most important thing are my paintings.
So i did the one page website. I used html, css, javascript and php. 
My future plans are to add more media queries, the „Load more“ button for my paintings, portfolio gallery with filtering, 
quotes slideshow and parallax scrolling.
